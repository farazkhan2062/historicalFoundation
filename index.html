  <h2>Pre‑Pakistan Education (712–1947)</h2>
  <div class="text">Maktabs and Madrasahs were the main centers of education in the early Muslim period of the subcontinent. They provided instruction in the Qur’an, Arabic, Persian, mathematics, and basic sciences. Education was largely free and supported by rulers and wealthy individuals. During the Mughal era, education flourished with the establishment of organized institutions and a broader curriculum. Subjects such as literature, philosophy, medicine, and astronomy were also taught. Later, British rule introduced modern schooling with English as the medium of instruction and a more formal education system..</div>

  <h2>Sir Syed Ahmed Khan</h2>
  <div class="text">Sir Syed Ahmed Khan strongly believed that modern scientific and English education was essential for the progress of Muslims in the subcontinent. After the War of Independence of 1857, he worked tirelessly to remove fear and misunderstanding of Western education among Muslims. In 1875, he founded the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental (MAO) College at Aligarh. The institution combined modern subjects with Islamic values. MAO College later became Aligarh Muslim University, a leading center of learning. Sir Syed’s efforts played a key role in the intellectual and educational revival of Muslims</div>

  <h2>Education After Independence</h2>
  <div class="text">After independence, Pakistan placed strong emphasis on improving literacy and expanding educational opportunities. Several education commissions were formed to plan and reform the education system. The establishment of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) helped improve the quality of universities and research. Teacher training and curriculum development also received attention. In 2010, Article 25-A was added to the Constitution through the 18th Amendment. This article guarantees free and compulsory education for children aged 5 to 16 years.</div>

  <h2>Bhutto Era Education (1972–1977)</h2>
  <div class="text">During the Bhutto era (1972–1977), the government introduced major reforms in the education sector. Many private schools and colleges were nationalized to ensure equal access to education. Education was declared free at various levels, which led to a significant increase in student enrollment. However, the rapid expansion created management and administrative difficulties. Shortage of trained teachers and resources affected educational quality. Political interference also became a challenge during this period.</div>
